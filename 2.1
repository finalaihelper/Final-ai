### Code Implementation for Final AI 2.1

Here’s the code to implement the **Final AI 2.1** update:

```python
import os
import sqlite3
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, render_template
from flask_caching import Cache

app = Flask(__name__)
cache = Cache(app, config={'CACHE_TYPE': 'simple'})

# Database initialization
def init_db():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('chatbot.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
                        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                        username TEXT UNIQUE,
                        password TEXT,
                        preferences TEXT)''')
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

# Load AI Models
def load_models():
    # Here you'd load your AI models like LLaMA 3.2 and Gemini
    pass

@app.route('/ask', methods=['POST'])
def ask():
    user_input = request.json.get('input')
    model_choice = request.json.get('model', 'llama')  # Default to LLaMA
    response = generate_response(user_input, model_choice)
    return jsonify({"response": response})

def generate_response(user_input, model_choice):
    # Logic to select the appropriate model and generate a response
    if model_choice == 'llama':
        return f"LLaMA response to: {user_input}"
    elif model_choice == 'gemini':
        return f"Gemini response to: {user_input}"
    else:
        return "Model not found."

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    init_db()
    load_models()
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up and Start Final AI 2.1

#### Step 1: Install Python

1. **Install Python**:
   - Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python.
   - Make sure to check “Add Python to PATH” during installation.

#### Step 2: Download the Final AI 2.1 Code

2. **Download the Code**:
   - Create a new folder on your computer for the project.
   - Inside this folder, create a file named `app.py` and copy the code above into it.

#### Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   - Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).
   - Navigate to your project folder:
     ```bash
     cd path\to\your\project
     ```
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows:
       ```bash
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On macOS/Linux:
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```

#### Step 4: Install Required Libraries

4. **Install Libraries**:
   - With the virtual environment activated, run this command to install Flask and other dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install flask flask-caching
     ```

#### Step 5: Run the Application

5. **Run the Application**:
   - In your terminal, make sure you're still in the project folder and your virtual environment is activated.
   - Run the app using:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - You should see a message indicating that the app is running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

#### Step 6: Access the Application

6. **Open the App in Your Browser**:
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
   - You should see the app’s homepage!

### Final Tips

- If you run into any errors, carefully read the error messages—they can guide you on what to fix.
- Always keep your virtual environment activated when working on the app.
- To stop the app, go back to your terminal and press `Ctrl + C`.

That’s it! You’ve successfully set up the **Final AI 2.1** update. If you have any questions or need further assistance, just let me know!
