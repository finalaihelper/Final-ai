Sure! Here’s a simple guide to help you set up the **Final AI 2.01** update on your computer. Just follow these steps, and you’ll be up and running in no time!

### Step 1: Get Python Installed

1. **Install Python**:
   - Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python.
   - During the installation, make sure to check the box that says “Add Python to PATH.” This makes it easier to run Python commands later.

### Step 2: Download the Final AI 2.01 Code

2. **Download the Code**:
   - You can either clone it from a GitHub repository or download it as a ZIP file.
   - If you’re using Git, open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and run:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
   - If you downloaded it as a ZIP, unzip the file to a folder on your computer.

### Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the code. You can do this using the `cd` command:
     ```bash
     cd path\to\your\folder
     ```
   - Now, create a virtual environment (this helps keep your project’s libraries separate):
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows:
       ```bash
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On macOS/Linux:
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```

### Step 4: Install Required Libraries

4. **Install Libraries**:
   - With the virtual environment activated, you need to install some libraries that the project uses. Run this command:
     ```bash
     pip install flask argon2-cffi cryptography flask-mail flask-jwt-extended flask-caching flask-limiter
     ```

### Step 5: Set Up Environment Variables

5. **Set Up Email Credentials**:
   - You need to provide your email credentials for the app to send emails. Create a new file named `.env` in your project folder and add the following lines (replace the placeholders with your actual email and password):
     ```
     EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
     EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
     ```

### Step 6: Initialize the Database

6. **Initialize the Database**:
   - Open the Python shell by typing `python` in your terminal.
   - Run the following code to set up the database:
     ```python
     import sqlite3
     conn = sqlite3.connect('chatbot.db')
     cursor = conn.cursor()
     cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
                         id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                         username TEXT UNIQUE,
                         password TEXT,
                         email TEXT UNIQUE,
                         reset_token TEXT,
                         role TEXT DEFAULT 'user',
                         data_sharing BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1,
                         privacy_setting TEXT DEFAULT 'standard',
                         encryption_key TEXT)''')
     # Add other tables as necessary...
     conn.commit()
     conn.close()
     ```

### Step 7: Run the Application

7. **Run the Application**:
   - Exit the Python shell and go back to your terminal. Make sure your virtual environment is still activated.
   - Run the app with the following command:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - If everything is set up correctly, the app should start running. You’ll see a message that says something like "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000".

### Step 8: Access the Application

8. **Open the App in Your Browser**:
   - Open your web browser and type in `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
   - You should see the app’s homepage!

### Final Tips

- If you encounter any errors, read the messages carefully—they often tell you what went wrong.
- Make sure you keep your virtual environment activated whenever you want to run or work on the app.
- If you want to stop the app, go back to your terminal and press `Ctrl + C`.

And that’s it! You’ve successfully set up the **Final AI 2.01** update on your computer. If you have any questions or need help, feel free to ask!
